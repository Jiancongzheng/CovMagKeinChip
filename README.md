## Task
This task is oriented to reduce the language barrier for the communication and the dissemination of information during the self-quarantine period. There are many residents and migrants liviing in Germany who cannot speak sufficient German or English. Our goal is to develop the prototype of a multi-language information system which can collect information from reliable sources and should then transtale it into several languages so that people with different culture and language backgrounds can easily check the updates and get important notices in time.
## Implementation
The project is based on python code.
